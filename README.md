This is a coding challenge for EZ Funnls. To run this project, run "npm install" in the root directory, then go into the client folder, and run "yarn install". Once everything is installed, go into the root directory and run "node server.js" then open a new tab in the terminal, and go into client folder and run "yarn start". You will need your own API Key to use this app. in client/ create a .env file and write "REACT_APP_API_KEY=(Your api key here)". then the client/src/utils/constants.js file will be able to import your api key in and you will be able to use this application.
